# Basic Python Programming

### Description

The UW HYAK team's non-comprehensive adaptation of Software Carpentry "Plotting and Programming in Python" Jupyter Notebooks for the CEI REU workshop held on June 20, 2024. Please see the Software Carpentry LICENSE.md included in this repository for more information and links to the original materials. 

### What's Here? 

***Jupyter Notebooks*** that walk through basic Python foundational concepts, data structures, and explores some methods for plotting with matplotlib. 
    
* Notebooks starting **00-08** can be followed workbook style by running the code blocks to demonstrate presented concepts. This set of Notebooks excludes the solutions to the Exercises. 

* Notebooks starting **S00-S08** are duplicates of the Notebooks starting **00-08**, but this set of Notebooks include the solutions to the Exercises. 

* Notebooks starting **09-10** provide plotting examples from Gaussian outputs.
