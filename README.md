# Clean Energy Institute REU 

### What's here? 

1. python_plotting subdirectory - these materials accompany the "Basic Python Programming" workshop held on June 20, 2024. 
* **Jupyter notebooks were adapted from  Software Carpentry's "Plotting and Programming in Python".**
    * Notebooks starting **00-08** can be followed workbook style by running the code blocks to demonstrate presented concepts. This set of Notebooks excludes the solutions to the Exercises. 
    * Notebooks starting **S00-S08** are duplicates of the Notebooks starting **00-08**, but this set of Notebooks include the solutions to the Exercises. 
    * Notebooks starting **09-10** provide plotting examples from Gaussian outputs. 
* The notebooks are meant to be a resource for your reference after the workshop has concluded. The workshop will be a hands on coding demonstration. The notebooks include additional practice exercises. 

2. **Using_Quantum_Chemistry_Software subdirectory - these materials accompany the "Using Gaussian for Computational Chemistry" workshop held on June 27, 2024.**
    
* Chem_Software_Hyak.pdf - This document will provide example files, helpful commands, and scripts so you are able to:
    * Use the [GaussView](https://gaussian.com/gaussview6/) graphical user interface
    * Create and submit [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) jobs
    * Create and submit [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) jobs
* ethane.sh file - This file will allow slurm submission of the ethane.gjf file

* Pseudopotential .upf files - The extra files used in the Quantum Espresso portion of the example.

3. **Data analysis in Python using regression analysis in `scikit-learn` and neural networks with `PyTorch`.**
* Complete Jupyter Notebook
* Jupyter Notebook with TODO in session code boxes for demonstration.
