# Clean Energy Institute REU 

### What's here? 

1. python_plotting subdirectory - these materials accompany the "Basic Python Programming" workshop held on June 20, 2024. 
    * Jupyter notebooks (00-08) are adapted from  Software Carpentry's "Plotting and Programming in Python".
        * The notebooks are meant to be a resource for your reference after the workshop has concluded.
        * The workshop will be a hands on coding demonstration. 
        * The notebooks include additional practice exercises. 
    * Jupyter notebooks (09-10) demonstrate some methods to plot vibrational spectra and long-range spectra outputs from Gaussian. 

2. Using_Quantum_Chemistry_Software subdirectory - these materials accompany the "Using Gaussian for Computational Chemistry" workshop held on June 27, 2024. 
    
    1. Chem_Software_Hyak.pdf
    
        This document will provide example files, helpful commands, and scripts so you are able to:
        * Use the [GaussView](https://gaussian.com/gaussview6/) graphical user interface
        * Create and submit [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) jobs
        * Create and submit [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) jobs

    2. ethane.sh file

        This file will allow slurm submission of the ethane.gjf file

    3. Pseudopotential .upf files

        The extra files used in the Quantum Espresso portion of the example.
