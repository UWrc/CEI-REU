### What's here? 

1. **python_plotting subdirectory - these materials accompany the "Basic Python Programming" workshop held on June 20, 2024.**
* Jupyter notebooks were adapted from  Software Carpentry's "Plotting and Programming in Python".
    * Notebooks starting **00-08** can be followed workbook style by running the code blocks to demonstrate presented concepts. This set of Notebooks excludes the solutions to the Exercises. 
    * Notebooks starting **S00-S08** are duplicates of the Notebooks starting **00-08**, but this set of Notebooks include the solutions to the Exercises. 
    * Notebooks starting **09-10** provide plotting examples from Gaussian outputs. 
* The notebooks are meant to be a resource for your reference after the workshop has concluded. The workshop will be a hands on coding demonstration. The notebooks include additional practice exercises. 

2. **sub-directory - these materials accompany the "Using Hyak, Linux Operating System" workshop held on June 25, 2024. The walk-through tutorial is available on Hyak's documentation website (hyak.uw.edu).**
* locator_NN_job.slurm - template single job SLURM submission script. 
* locator_NN_array.slurm - template array job SLURM submission script.
* data sub-directory - Our adaptation of *Populus trichocarpa* genotype data and locations are licensed under a CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication license. Original genotyping results available on DRYAD https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1051d. Data were published as part of a study  https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12056.

3. **Using_Quantum_Chemistry_Software subdirectory - these materials accompany the "Using Gaussian for Computational Chemistry" workshop held on June 27, 2024.**
    
* Chem_Software_Hyak.pdf - This document will provide example files, helpful commands, and scripts so you are able to:
    * Use the [GaussView](https://gaussian.com/gaussview6/) graphical user interface
    * Create and submit [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) jobs
    * Create and submit [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) jobs
* ethane.sh file - This file will allow slurm submission of the ethane.gjf file

* Pseudopotential .upf files - The extra files used in the Quantum Espresso portion of the example.

4. **analysis sub-directory - these material accompany WS 4 "Data Analysis Basics in Python with `scikit-learn` and `PyTorch`" workshop held on July 1, 2024.**
* Complete Jupyter Notebook
* Jupyter Notebook with "TODO" or in-session code boxes for demonstration.
